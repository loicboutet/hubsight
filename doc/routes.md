## üéØ ROUTE ORGANIZATION PRINCIPLES

### 1. RESTful Convention
All routes follow standard REST conventions:
- `GET /resources` - Index/List
- `GET /resources/new` - New form
- `POST /resources` - Create
- `GET /resources/:id` - Show
- `GET /resources/:id/edit` - Edit form
- `PATCH /resources/:id` - Update
- `DELETE /resources/:id` - Delete

### 2. Nested Resources
Resources are nested when there's a strong parent-child relationship:
- Buildings belong to sites: `/sites/:site_id/buildings`
- Contacts belong to organizations: `/organizations/:organization_id/contacts`

### 3. Role-Based Namespacing
- `/admin/*` - Admin-only routes
- `/my_*` - Site manager scoped routes
- Root level - Portfolio manager routes

### 4. Action Routes
Special actions use descriptive names:
- `/:id/validate` - Validation workflows
- `/:id/acknowledge` - Acknowledgment actions
- `/:id/pdf` - PDF generation
- `/import` - Import workflows
- `/export` - Export workflows

### 5. Search & Autocomplete
- `/search` - Complex search interfaces
- `/search/:resource` - Resource-specific search
- `/api/autocomplete/:resource` - Autocomplete endpoints

---

## üìã IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Authorization Strategy
Routes are protected by:
1. Authentication (all routes except login/password)
2. Role-based access (Admin, Portfolio Manager, Site Manager)
3. Scope-based access (Site Managers see only assigned sites)

### DRY Principles Applied
- Shared partials for common forms (site, building, equipment)
- Unified search infrastructure
- Common authorization policies
- Reusable autocomplete endpoints

### KISS Principles Applied
- Simple RESTful patterns
- Clear naming conventions
- Minimal route nesting (max 2 levels)
- Predictable URL structure

### Future Considerations
Routes excluded from scope but may be added later:
- External contractor portal routes
- Intervention request routes
- Insurance claims routes
- Investment planning routes
- Electronic signature workflows
- Mobile app API routes
